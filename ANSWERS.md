- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
        I would use Class components if I need to hold state or use lifecycle methods.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes
       Render: handles the rendering of the component.
       componentDidMount: it is called as soon as the component is mounted and ready, good place for API calls.
       componentDidUpdate: it updates the DOM in response to prop or state changes.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    The main purpose is to reuse stateful logic.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
   To save us time and energy in the future being able to find bugs easily.
